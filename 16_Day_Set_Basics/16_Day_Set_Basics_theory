# Python Sets

# Python set is an unordered collection of multiple items having different datatypes. In Python, sets are mutable, unindexed and do not contain duplicates. The order of elements in a set is not preserved and can change.

# Can store None values.
# Implemented using hash tables internally.
# Do not implement interfaces like Serializable or Cloneable.
# Python sets are not inherently thread-safe; synchronization is needed if used across threads.

# set1 = {1,2,3,4}
# print(set1)
# set2 = {1,3,2,7,6,5,2,3,1}
# print(set2)

# Using the set() function
# Python Sets can be created by using the built-in set() 
# function with an iterable object or a sequence by placing the sequence 
# inside curly braces, separated by a 'comma'.

set1 = set()
print(set1)

set1 = set("GeeksForGeeks")
print(set1)

# Creating a Set with the use of a List
set1 = set(["Geeks", "For", "Geeks"])
print(set1)

# Creating a Set with the use of a tuple
tup = ("Geeks", "for", "Geeks")
print(set(tup))

# Creating a Set with the use of a dictionary
d = {"Geeks": 1, "for": 2, "Geeks": 3}
print(set(d))
